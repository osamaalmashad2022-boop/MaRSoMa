One afternoon, after feeling unusually overwhelmed, my older cousin advised me to develop a hobby. At first, I thought the idea was unnecessary. How could spending time on a hobby possibly help when I had so much to study?\n\nHowever, a week later, I decided to give it a try and joined a small weekend workshop on ceramic art. On the first day, I struggled. The clay was supposed to be easy to shape, yet my hands couldn't control it. Still, as the instructor encouraged me to continue, I began to notice something unexpected: my mind slowly relaxed. Creating something with my hands allowed me to disconnect from stress and focus on one simple task.\n\nBy the end of the month, I had not only made a few bowls but also discovered that having a hobby gives you balance. It reminds you that your identity is more than grades, and that personal growth can come from patience, creativity, and learning something entirely new.",

One evening, while scrolling through videos online, I saw a tutorial on making handmade key chains using beads and threads. It looked fun, so I tried it just to relax.\n\nAt first, the key chains were supposed to be simple, but mine kept coming out uneven. Still, I enjoyed the process. Every evening, I practiced a little, and my designs slowly improved. One day, I brought a few key chains to school, and my friends were surprised that I had made them myself. Two classmates asked if I could make key chains with their initials—and they offered to pay.\n\nI didn't expect to earn money from something I did for fun, but soon teachers and other students began requesting customized designs. I created a small price list and even started making special key chains for school events. What began as a way to relax became a small source of income.\n\nBy the end of the term, I learned that hobbies are not just for enjoyment. With creativity, practice, and effort, a hobby can grow into an opportunity. Sometimes, what you do in your free time can become your first step toward entrepreneurship.",
