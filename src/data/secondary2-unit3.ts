          body: "In one of Alexandria's oldest neighborhoods, narrow streets once filled with dust and broken walls began to change. It all started with a young artist named Salma Nasser, a fine arts student who believed that art could heal people's spirits. She noticed how the gray walls made her neighbors feel sad and invisible. One day, she carried her brushes and paints to the street and began to draw a large mural of a white dove rising above the city skyline. Beneath it, she wrote the words: 'Peace begins here.'\n\nAt first, people watched in silence. Then a child offered to help her mix colors. The next day, more students joined in, painting scenes of kindness, friendship, and clean streets. Their work attracted attention on social media. Tourists and journalists began visiting the neighborhood. The once-forgotten walls became a symbol of unity and hope.\n\nSoon, the movement spread to other cities like Cairo and Fayoum. For Salma, the murals were more than decoration—they were inspiring messages that encouraged people to act with compassion. She said, 'Art can speak louder than words. When people see beauty and meaning around them, they change their behavior.' Today, Salma's neighborhood is brighter, cleaner, and more alive than ever. The walls continue to tell their story.",
