          body: "Do you ever wonder why some people always arrive promptly for everything, while others are always running late? Psychologists say that by the time we reach adulthood, we will have developed a specific perception of time.\n\nPsychologists divide people into two groups. The first group includes 'Clock People' who are usually punctual. They see time as a straight line, like a road — a valuable resource that must be managed carefully, like money. For these people, being late means losing time and showing a lack of respect.\n\nThe second group includes 'Event People' who are frequently late. This group sees time more flexibly. For them, finishing a current activity is more important than the clock. They are often optimistic and truly believe they can complete many tasks in a short time. This is called the 'planning fallacy.'\n\nWhile being late can be annoying, studies show it is not usually because the person is intentionally rude. Often, it reflects a spontaneous personality type that focuses more on what is happening now.",

Unlike money, which you can earn back, lost time is gone forever. This idea is central to good time management. When you are organized, you reduce stress and increase your productivity.\n\nTo value your time, you must treat it like money in your bank account. Experts suggest that if you start managing your time today, by this time next year, you will have achieved your most important goals. Wasting time often happens because we don't plan. Spending hours checking social media or starting too many tasks at once is simply not efficient. However, if you set firm deadlines now, by the end of the month, you will have finished all your difficult projects.\n\nFinally, take short, planned breaks to keep your focus sharp. By valuing and managing your time, you invest in your future and ensure a longer, happier lifespan. If you follow these habits, by the time you graduate, you will have mastered the art of productivity.",
