Water also makes your joints slippery so you can move easily without stiffness. It helps your brain function properly so you don't feel confused. Your kidneys need water to wash out bad things (toxins) from your body. Doctors recommend drinking at least 8 glasses of water every day to stay healthy and energetic.",

Research shows that this kind of thinking is not just good for your mood—it can seriously affect your health.\n\nWhen you think positively, your body has less stress because you worry less. High stress can weaken your immune system, making you sick easily. Positive thinking helps keep your immune system strong. Studies show that optimists often have better heart health and a longer lifespan. They also recover faster from illness or surgery.\n\nWe all have negative thoughts sometimes, but we can change this habit. Practice Gratitude: every night, write down three good things that happened that day. Use positive self-talk: change 'I can't do this' to 'I can try this.' Stay connected: spend time with people who make you feel happy and energetic. By practicing these simple ideas, you can use the power of your mind to live a happier and healthier life.",
