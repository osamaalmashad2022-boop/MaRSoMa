For example, the Olympic Games began in Greece more than 2,700 years ago. They included running, wrestling, and discus throwing. These games were not only for fun, but also to bring communities together.\n\nLater, the Romans enjoyed sports such as gladiator fights and chariot racing. Although some of these were dangerous, they showed how important sport was in Roman culture. In the Middle Ages, people in Europe practiced archery, horse riding, and fencing. These activities prepared knights for battles, and they also became forms of competition.\n\nModern sports started to grow in the 19th century. Football, tennis, and cricket became popular in England and soon spread across the world. The modern Olympic Games were restarted in 1896 in Athens, and today they are a global event where athletes from many countries compete in peace.\n\nSport is now practiced not only for winning, but also for teamwork, fair play, and health. It continues to connect people, create friendships, and inspire new generations.",

Ships claimed to have seen a huge 'sea monster,' moving faster than whales and smashing ships with terrible force. Newspapers described it as both marvelous and terrifying. Public debate grew so intense that a voyage was launched to capture or kill the beast.\n\nProfessor Pierre Aronnax, a French marine scientist, was invited to join the voyage. His loyal servant Conseil and a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land also became part of the crew. They boarded a warship and set sail across the Pacific. For months, they searched without success.\n\nAt last, one evening, a long glowing shape appeared in the waves. The crew chased it desperately. Cannon fire and harpoons were launched. Suddenly, the 'monster' turned and hit the ship with its steel-like body. Aronnax and his companions were thrown into the sea. Struggling to survive, they swam toward the mysterious creature. To their astonishment, they discovered it was not an animal at all — but a man-made submarine of special design. Their adventure beneath the oceans was about to begin.",
