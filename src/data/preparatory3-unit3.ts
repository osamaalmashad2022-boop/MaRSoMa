It exists as software — you can't touch it. Robots, on the other hand, are physical machines that can move and perform tasks. Some robots use AI to become smarter, but not all robots have AI, and not all AI is inside a robot. For example, the voice assistant on your phone uses AI, but it's not a robot. A factory robot that puts cars together might not use AI at all — it just follows programmed instructions. AI has limits. It can process information much faster than humans, but it cannot truly understand emotions or have personal experiences. It doesn't get tired, hungry, or scared. While AI can recognize a smile in a photo, it doesn't know what happiness feels like.",

She raised her hand, and TeachBot gave a clear explanation. But something felt different. When Sara made a joke, TeachBot didn't laugh. When she felt sad about a bad grade, TeachBot said, 'Your score is below average. Try again.' It was accurate but not kind. By Friday, Sara missed her real teacher, Miss Heba. Miss Heba would notice when students were upset. She would smile, tell funny stories, and encourage them.
